# Meme-Bot

## What it does

### There are several functions that my bot has, namely:

~**Meme creation** using PIL, where users can use the !meme command to specify text to go on any of the 12 meme templates included.

~**Random joke** using the pyjokes API, where users can use the !joke command to get a joke from the bot.

~**Anonymous messages**, where users can send an anonymous message to the channel with the !anon command

~**Purge messages** (Admin only) for easy channel cleanup

~**Magic 8 Ball** via the !ask command, where the user gets a response to a question

~**Coin flip** and **custom dice rolling** via the !flip and !roll commands
